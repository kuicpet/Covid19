#BuildForSDG Cohort-1 JavaScript Assessment
This assessment empowers you to attempt helping society and leaders prepare for the real rig problem
of COVID-19, which is its impact on lives, our health systems, and the economy:
. Too many patients, not enough hospitals and beds. A serious shortage of ventilators, masks
and other PPE if we don ºt practice extreme social distancing.
. Job losses or freezes, low cash flow and low production of essentials like food, from too
many being sick or people caring for their sick loved ones.
Project Setup & Submission Process

Go here for a guide and step-by-step video on how to setup your project and submit your work.

#Challenges
You will be building a novelty COVID-19 infections predictor estimator following guidelines outlined in the challenges.
Your estimator will receive input data structured as:

{
region: {
name: "Africa",
avgAge: 19.7,
avgDailyIncomeInUSD: 5,
avgDailyIncomePopulation: 0.71
},
periodType: "days",
timeToElapse: 58,
reportedCases: 674,
population: 66622705,
totalHospitalBeds: 1380614
}

and the output will be required to be an impact estimatation having the data structure specified as :

{
data: {}, // the input data you got
impact: {}, // your best case estimation
severeImpact: {} // your severe case estimation
}

This assessment is broken down into several challenges, incrementally helping you build out your COVID-
19 impact estimator.

Locate the src/estimator.js file. This is where you will be writing all of your code. Feel free to create
your own additional functions within this file (or in other files, which you then import into this file) to get
the work done, but make sure to not alter the definition for the covid19ImpactEstimator function or
its export declaration. covid19ImpactEstimator is the entry point to your work, and the one thing we'll
be evaluating.
Your computations should be saved into the impact and severeImpact objects of the return
output data structure.

#Challenge 1

Given the reportedCases property in the input data to your covid19ImpactEstimator function,
estimate the number of currently infected people as reportedCases * 10. This figure will be part of
your output estimate, saved as the currentlyInfected property (i.e impact.currentlyInfected is
reportedCases * 10).
According to Harvard Medical School / Massachusetts General Hospital (see the references at the end of
this guide), there are likely up to 50x more people infected than known reported cases. Based on this,
compute currentlyInfected for the severeImpact output as reportedCases * 50 (i.e
severeImpact.currentlyInfected is reportedCases * 50)



To estimate the number of infected people 30 days from now, note that currentlyInfected doubles
every 3 days, so you'd have to multiply it by a factor of 2.
E.g: currentlyInfected x (2 to the power of *factor*) where factor is 10 for a 30 day
duration (there are 10 sets of 3 days in a perioid of 30 days)
Effectively, the projected number of infections after a 30 day period is

currentlyInfected x (2 to the power of 10)

OR, simply

currentlyInfected x 1024

This computation should be saved as infectionsByRequestedTime, and should done both for impact
and severeImpact, using their respective currentlyInfected values.
For the rest of this assessment, just like you have done for currentlyInfected and
infectionsByRequestedTime, you will be doing all required computations in two fold. One for
impact, and the other for severImpact

PS: Your estimator will be required to make estimations over periods in days, weeks and months.
We recommend you make an effort to normalise the duration input to days, and then do your
computation based on that

#Challenge 2

Determine 15% of infectionsByRequestedTime. This is the estimated number of severe positive
cases that will require hospitalization to recover. Represent this as severeCasesByRequestedTime and
make it a part of your estimation output
Given severeCasesByRequestedTime, determine the number of available beds. On average, 65% of
hospital beds are already occupied by patients and many hospitals usually are at 90% or 95% capacity.
We want to expect only a 35% bed availability in hospitals for severe COVID-19 positive patients.
Based on the above, the totalHospitalBeds input data, and your severeCasesByRequestedTime,
estimate the number of available hospital beds for severe COVID-19 positive patients. E.g 23 (meaning
only 23 hospital beds will be available), or -350 (meaning there'll be a shortage of 350 beds for severe
patients after hospitals are full to capacity)
Represent your beds computation as hospitalBedsByRequestedTime and make it a part of your
estimation output.

#Challenge 3


Determine 5% of infectionsByRequestedTime. This is the estimated number of severe positive cases
that will require ICU care. Represent this as casesForICUByRequestedTime and make it a part of your
estimation output.
Also, determine 2% of infectionsByRequestedTime. This is the estimated number of severe positive
cases that will require ventilators. Represent this as casesForVentilatorsByRequestedTime and
make it a part of your estimation output.
Finally, given the estimated number of infected people by the requested time and the AVG daily income
of the region, estimate how much money the economy is likely to lose over the said period. Save this as
dollarsInFlight in your output data structure. E.g if 65% of the region (the majority) earn $1.5 a day,
you can compute dollarsInFlight over a 30 day period as:

(infectionsByRequestedTime x 0.65 x 1.5) / 30;

#UPDATE: Though dollarsInFlight is a monetary value, treat it like the other values you have
#computed - discard the decimal portion, such that 4732.645 becomes 4732.


PS: At this point, you've now completed the first part of building your estimator. Did you notice
that it is not accounting for deaths or recoveries over time? This is a novelty estimator, but we
hope it gives you ideas of how you can use technology, open source, and research to attempt
providing advocacy and advisory to any cause, including the COVID-19 pandemic.
Challenge 4

Here, you are only required to do one of the tasks below. Ideally, you should choose the frontend or
backend task basd on your skill and preference, which should also be in alignment with the data you
submitted while applying into the #BuildforSDG program. Finally, once you make it into the program, the
task you completed here will strongly influence the role you will play in your team.

If you feel up to it, try completing both the frontend and backend tasks, especially if you want to
function as fullsatck developer in the program.

#Tasks A - For Frontend Developers

Build a simple single page web app that can allow the data passed to your estimator function to be
inputed from a UI. Your goal is to build a simple UI that
. Scores a minimum of 75 for performance, best practices, SEO, and accessibility, as measured by
Chrome's Lighthouse tool. Host your web app with GitHub pages (or Netlify), and make sure the
root of your project has a .env file with a FRONTEND entry pointing to the link of your hosted and
running UI app. E.g:

FRONTEND=http://url-of-hosted-and-running-web-app

. Can allow a user enter data with some input fields, and then click on a button which passes the
data to the estimation function you built from challeng 1 to 3. In the UI, designate each input field with a HTML attribute as follows: 

input for population data has attribute of data-population input for timeToElapse data has attribute of data-time-to-elapse input for reportedCases data has attribute of data-reported-cases input for totalHospitalBeds data has attribute of data-total-hospital-beds input for periodType data has attribute of data-period-type and should be a SELECT or RADIO input field with values limited to days, weeks, or months the button for submitting the data from the UI should have an attribute of data-go- estimate. 
Feel free to handle submission with the data-go-estimate button and pass the data from the input fields to your estimation function. Though this is not required (we won't even check), doing it helps you have a functional UI you can show off! 

#Task B - For Backend Develoeprs 

Build a simple REST API around your estimator function and host it on Heroku or any other free service. Your REST API should allow a user make a HTTP POST request to your endpoint, providing the data normally passed to your estimator function, and get back the estimation data produced by your estimator function. Specifically, your API should : 
. Have a /api/v1/on-covid-19 endpoint that can take the input data and return the estimation for it. Sure you can handle the response using the function you built from challenge 1 to 3. Also, have the default response format be JSON, but allow the user specify a response format by terminating the request URL with /json for JSON and /xml for XML. E.g: If your API is hosted on http://example.com, the endpoint will be http://example.com/api/v1/on-covid-19/ and http://example.com/api/v1/on-covid-19/xml will produce the response in XML format and with the right HTTP response headers for XML content. Make sure the root of your project has a .env file with a BACKEND entry pointing to the link of your hosted and running REST API. E.g: 
BACKEND=http://url-of-hosted-and-running-REST-api 
. Maintain a request / response time difference log that is accessibale via /api/v1/on-covid- 
19/logs. The logs endpoint should produce a newline-separated list of entries for each request / response cycle. For every request you get and for which you served a response, log an entry into the logs. Your logs can be saved to a database, a JSON file or whatever you decide is best for persistence, but after calling your API 3 times, there should be 3 additional entries in the logs. A valid response from the /logs endpoint should be text data with entries containing a timestamp, the request path, and how long it took to handle the request. Separate timestamp, the request path, and the time difference with 2 tab spaces (i.e \t\t), but recall that each record needs to be on a new line. See below for an example 
1585703407605 on-covid-19 done in 1.20 seconds 1585703407625 on-covid-19/json done in 1.35 seconds 1585703407659 on-covid-19/xml done in 2.50 seconds
